Flatpaks can be easily installed in Discover and through the terminal with the ${LIGHT_BLUE}flatpak${RESET} command, and AppImageLauncher is included with the system for easy integration.
You can install normal Fedora packages with ${LIGHT_BLUE}rpm-ostree${RESET}, but this should only be used as a last resort. Prefer installing these applications in a distrobox.\n"
