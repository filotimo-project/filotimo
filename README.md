### See https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/tduck973564/filotimo-packages/ for our packages

## [Download an ISO here](https://download.filotimoproject.org/filotimo-latest.iso), and [the checksum here](https://download.filotimoproject.org/filotimo-latest.iso-CHECKSUM)

## Rebasing from Kinoite/other Fedora atomic distros
```
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/filotimo-project/filotimo-nvidia:latest
```
Then reboot into the OS, rebase to a signed copy
```
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/filotimo-project/filotimo-nvidia:latest
```
Then reboot, and install the base set of Flatpaks
```
ujust reinstall-system-flatpaks
```
Then, if necessary, re-enroll Secure Boot keys (password is `universalblue`)
```
ujust enroll-secure-boot-key
```
It's recommended that you make a new user account after rebasing. Some tweaks and configs are only re-applied to a new user.

## TODO
TODO: Branch for versions
Make stable version of image, which follows the creation of a new versioned branch, like bazzite. this version should be reflected in the system.
Reset rechunker on each feature addition number change, or major upstream version change
something like 40.feature addition number.minor bugfix number

TODO: Build separate isos for all image variants


## Container Signing

Container signing is important for end-user security and is enabled on all Universal Blue images. It is recommended you set this up, and by default the image builds *will fail* if you don't.

This provides users a method of verifying the image.

1. Install the [cosign CLI tool](https://edu.chainguard.dev/open-source/sigstore/cosign/how-to-install-cosign/#installing-cosign-with-the-cosign-binary)

2. Run inside your repo folder:

    ```bash
    cosign generate-key-pair
    ```

    
    - Do NOT put in a password when it asks you to, just press enter. The signing key will be used in GitHub Actions and will not work if it is encrypted.

> [!WARNING]
> Be careful to *never* accidentally commit `cosign.key` into your git repo.

3. Add the private key to GitHub

    - This can also be done manually. Go to your repository settings, under Secrets and Variables -> Actions

    Add a new secret and name it `SIGNING_SECRET`, then paste the contents of `cosign.key` into the secret and save it. Make sure it's the .key file and not the .pub file. Once done, it should look like this:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1264109/216735690-2d19271f-cee2-45ac-a039-23e6a4c16b34.png)

    - (CLI instructions) If you have the `github-cli` installed, run:

    ```bash
    gh secret set SIGNING_SECRET < cosign.key
    ```

4. Commit the `cosign.pub` file into your git repository
